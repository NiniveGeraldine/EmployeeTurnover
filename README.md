# Employee Turnover
A model to predict employee turnover (whether an employee stays or quits) using decision trees and random forests. The decision trees and random forests are interactable i.e. parameters such as minimum depth and minimum splits can be changed directly. As such, the prediction accuracies can be changed depending on the chosen parameters.  

_Note:_ Some visualizations, including the decision tree and the random foresst, cannot be rendered natively within GitHub. To view these visualizations, please open the notebook in a dedicated Jupyter Notebook viewer, such as https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/
